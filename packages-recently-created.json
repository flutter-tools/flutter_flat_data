DCli uses waitFor to eliminate async code in the DCli libraries which precludes DCli's usage in non-cli apps (e.g. you can't use it in flutter). The aim of dcli_core is to expose a significant set of the core dcli functions as async version so that dcli_core can be used in any project. DCli will then rely on dcli_core for core parts of its implemenation to avoid duplicating code between the two packages.","url":"https://pub.dev/packages/dcli_core","changelogUrl":"https://pub.dev/packages/dcli_core/changelog","grantedPoints":"100","maxPoints":"130","likeCount":"0","popularityScore":"0.0","lastUpdated":"2021-11-19T00:45:23.845269Z"},{"name":"pulsar_iot_client","version":"1.0.0","description":"Apache Pulsar IoT client","url":"https://pub.dev/packages/pulsar_iot_client","changelogUrl":"https://pub.dev/packages/pulsar_iot_client/changelog","grantedPoints":"50","maxPoints":"130","likeCount":"0","popularityScore":"0.0","lastUpdated":"2021-11-18T22:52:17.263065Z"},{"name":"file_finder","version":"0.1.1","description":"Package to find files in android device","url":"https://pub.dev/packages/file_finder","changelogUrl":"https://pub.dev/packages/file_finder/changelog","grantedPoints":"100","maxPoints":"130","likeCount":"1","popularityScore":"0.0","lastUpdated":"2021-11-18T21:40:08.518957Z"},{"name":"planningcenter_api","version":"0.1.2","description":"Supports nearly 100% of the Planning Center public API.","url":"https://pub.dev/packages/planningcenter_api","changelogUrl":"https://pub.dev/packages/planningcenter_api/changelog","grantedPoints":"110","maxPoints":"130","likeCount":"0","popularityScore":"0.0","lastUpdated":"2021-11-19T18:22:38.842562Z"},{"name":"routing_client_dart","version":"0.1.0","description":"Dart Package for Routing Client Api","url":"https://pub.dev/packages/routing_client_dart","changelogUrl":"https://pub.dev/packages/routing_client_dart/changelog","grantedPoints":"100","maxPoints":"130","likeCount":"0","popularityScore":"0.0","lastUpdated":"2021-11-18T19:54:33.781721Z"},{"name":"text_form_field_wrapper","version":"1.0.0","description":"A ui wrapper for expressing border shapes around text form fields","url":"https://pub.dev/packages/text_form_field_wrapper","changelogUrl":"https://pub.dev/packages/text_form_field_wrapper/changelog","grantedPoints":"130","maxPoints":"130","likeCount":"4","popularityScore":"0.0","lastUpdated":"2021-11-18T19:46:58.700885Z"},{"name":"telegram_client","version":"0.0.1","description":"telegram client library to make bot or userbot Support Telegram Api and Support Tdlib Telegram Database Library.","url":"https://pub.dev/packages/telegram_client","changelogUrl":"https://pub.dev/packages/telegram_client/changelog","grantedPoints":"95","maxPoints":"130","likeCount":"0","popularityScore":"0.0","lastUpdated":"2021-11-20T06:47:55.098428Z"},{"name":"custom_top_navigator","version":"0.0.3","description":"A flutter package that makes it easy to create your own navigator anywhere in the widget tree.","url":"https://pub.dev/packages/custom_top_navigator","changelogUrl":"https://pub.dev/packages/custom_top_navigator/changelog","grantedPoints":"110","maxPoints":"130","likeCount":"2","popularityScore":"0.0","lastUpdated":"2021-11-18T17:14:05.544752Z"},{"name":"go_sell_sdk_flutter_null_safe","version":"2.0.10","description":"Flutter plugin compatible version of goSellSDK library for both Android and iOS.","url":"https://pub.dev/packages/go_sell_sdk_flutter_null_safe","changelogUrl":"https://pub.dev/packages/go_sell_sdk_flutter_null_safe/changelog","grantedPoints":"100","maxPoints":"130","likeCount":"1","popularityScore":"0.0","lastUpdated":"2021-11-18T16:39:47.547404Z"},{"name":"import_lint","version":"0.2.2","description":"The Import Lint package defines import lint rules and report on lints found in Dart code.","url":"https://pub.dev/packages/import_lint","changelogUrl":"https://pub.dev/packages/import_lint/changelog","grantedPoints":"120","maxPoints":"130","likeCount":"2","popularityScore":"0.0","lastUpdated":"2021-11-21T09:14:28.029921Z"},{"name":"flutter_simple_image_utils","version":"0.0.1","description":"A new Flutter package project.","url":"https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_simple_image_utils","changelogUrl":"https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_simple_image_utils/changelog","grantedPoints":"110","maxPoints":"130","likeCount":"1","popularityScore":"0.0","lastUpdated":"2021-11-18T16:04:44.849504Z"},{"name":"math_parser","version":"1.0.0","description":"Process math expressions, convert them to machine-readable form, and calculate them.","url":"https://pub.dev/packages/math_parser","changelogUrl":"https://pub.dev/packages/math_parser/changelog","grantedPoints":"130","maxPoints":"130","likeCount":"0","popularityScore":"0.0","lastUpdated":"2021-11-18T16:49:43.648678Z"},{"name":"easy_integration_testing","version":"0.0.2","description":"A new Flutter package project.
